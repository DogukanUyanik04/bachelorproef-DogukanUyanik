abstract = {The Meta Quest 2 is one of the most popular Virtual Reality (VR) entertainment headsets to date. The headset, developed by Meta Platforms Inc., immerses the user in a completely simulated environment. Some VR environments can be shared over the Internet to allow users to communicate and interact with one another and share their experiences. Unfortunately, the safety of these VR environments cannot always be guaranteed, generating a risk that users may be exposed to illicit online behaviour in the form of online harassment, grooming, and cyberbullying. Therefore, forensic examiners must be able to conduct sound forensic analysis of VR headsets to investigate these criminal investigations. In this study, we conduct digital forensic acquisition and analysis of the Meta Quest 2 VR headset. Analysis of the forensic image exemplified that there were several digital artefacts relating to user activities, device information and stored digital artefacts that can be extracted in a forensically sound manner. The main contributions of this study include a detailed description of the forensic acquisition process, identification of internal file storage locations, and recovery and analysis of digital artefacts that can be used to aid VR forensic investigations.}
